\chapter{Appendix E: Ethical Considerations}
\label{app:ethics}

The development and deployment of emotion recognition technologies carry significant ethical responsibilities. This appendix outlines the primary ethical considerations relevant to this research and the mitigation strategies employed.

\section{Data Privacy and Anonymity}

The GoEmotions dataset is derived from public Reddit comments. While the data is public, the individuals who wrote the comments may not have anticipated their use in training an AI model for emotion recognition.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Consideration:} The potential for re-identification or misuse of personal, emotional expressions.
    \item \textbf{Mitigation:} This research treats the data as anonymized. No attempt was made to identify the authors of the comments. All examples used in this paper or in supplementary materials have been carefully selected to avoid revealing any personally identifiable information (PII).
\end{itemize}

\section{Bias in Models and Data}

AI models are known to learn and amplify biases present in their training data. The GoEmotions dataset, sourced from Reddit, reflects the demographics and cultural norms of its user base, which is not representative of the global population.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Consideration:} The model may perform differently for different demographic groups or may misinterpret culturally specific expressions of emotion. For example, expressions of joy or frustration may vary significantly across cultures.
    \item \textbf{Mitigation:} This research acknowledges this limitation explicitly. The findings are contextualized as being specific to the GoEmotions dataset. We advocate that any real-world deployment of such a model would require rigorous testing and fine-tuning on data that is representative of the target user population to identify and mitigate performance disparities.
\end{itemize}

\section{Risks of Misclassification}

The misclassification of emotion can have harmful consequences, particularly in sensitive applications.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Consideration:} A system that incorrectly flags a user's frustrated comment as "toxic anger" could lead to unfair censorship or penalties. A mental health application that misinterprets a cry for help as simple "sadness" could fail a vulnerable user.
    \item \textbf{Mitigation:} This research is presented as a foundational study, not a production-ready system. We emphasize the importance of human-in-the-loop systems for any high-stakes application. The "provenance logging" in our final pipeline is designed specifically to aid human moderators by showing them the model's confidence and potential points of ambiguity, rather than just a final, opaque decision.
\end{itemize}

\section{Dual-Use and Malicious Applications}

Emotion recognition technology can be used for malicious purposes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Consideration:} The technology could be used for manipulative advertising, invasive surveillance, or to identify and target emotionally vulnerable individuals.
    \item \textbf{Mitigation:} The authors of this study firmly advocate for the responsible and transparent use of AI. We believe that publishing this research in an open academic forum, where its methods, limitations, and ethical implications can be scrutinized by the community, is the best way to foster responsible innovation. We do not endorse any application of this technology that infringes on individual privacy or is used for manipulative purposes.
