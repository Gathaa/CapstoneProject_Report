This journey has been both challenging and transformative, shaping my academic and professional growth while testing my resilience. In moments of doubt and fatigue, I came to truly appreciate the support of those who stood by me.\\

\noindent I would first like to express my profound gratitude to my academic supervisor \emph{Dr.\ Jihene Ben Naceur}, whose guidance, patience, and encouragement carried me through the most difficult stages of this work. Her faith in me, even when I doubted myself, gave me the strength to push forward. I am equally indebted to my company supervisor at DataDoIt, \emph{Dr.\ Tarek Guesmi}, whose insightful advice and support enriched this research and reminded me of the bridge between academic rigor and real-world application.\\

\noindent My thanks also go to \emph{MedTech}, whose stimulating environment and collaborative spirit created the space for this work to grow. Even when the road felt overwhelming, the support from peers and faculty reminded me that I was not walking it alone.\\

\noindent Above all, my deepest appreciation goes to my family and friends, who carried me through every up and down with their unconditional love, patience, and belief in me.\\

\noindent This work is therefore not only the result of my effort, but also a testament to the support and resilience of all those who stood beside me. To each of you, I owe more than words can express.
